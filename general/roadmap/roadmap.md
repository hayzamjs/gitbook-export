# 2021

As you can see, many interesting things are coming up in 2021. Even if we have date targets to deliver these items, we have not added any timeline to this roadmap because we are evolving in such a complex environment that we prefer to focus on progress rather than the timeline. This being said, with the team in place we believe all of these items can be done before the end of 2021. We will also probably outsource some of the work to accelerate the development.
