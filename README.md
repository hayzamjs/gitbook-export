# Welcome to the Scala Wiki!

## What is Scala?

Scala is a secure, private, and mobile-friendly cryptocurrency linking IPFS and distributed technologies to build a globally scalable ecosystem. It provides an opaque blockchain, untraceable payments, unlinkable transactions, and blockchain-analysis resistance.

Our vision is to distribute wealth for everyone and every device. We want to be the peopleâ€™s coin. To achieve this goal, we focus on implementing solutions that are mobile-friendly and energy-efficient. There are about 4 billion mobile devices in the world, and we want to make sure that our ecosystem takes that into account. We also take a lot of time to improve the user experience so that our applications can be used easily by anyone.

Obviously, our goal is also to bring useful utilities and to solve real-world problems, in a way that is economically viable for the project and to sustain our growth. We take advantage of next-gen technologies such as IPFS, WebTorrent and custom software to provide the utility of data storage and we use the proven CryptoNote protocol for providing the financial aspects.
