# Panthera PoW algorithm

## (RandomX + Yespower + KangarooTwelve) = Panthera <a href="#ddf6" id="ddf6"></a>

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/panthera (1).png>)

Scala uses an algorithm technology combining [RandomX](https://github.com/tevador/RandomX) with our own variant of [yespower](https://www.openwall.com/yespower/)_._ In addition we have combined a quantum resistant algorithm called [KangarooTwelve](https://keccak.team/kangarootwelve.html) to create a new PoW algorithm that we called _Panthera_.&#x20;

It is faster than RandomX and is extremely resistant to not just _ASICs_ and _FPGAs,_ but is also rated level 2 quantum-resistant due to the inclusion of K12.

## Technical details <a href="#id-9337" id="id-9337"></a>

_RandomX_ utilizes a virtual machine that executes programs in a special instruction set that consists of integer math, floating point math and branches.

These programs can be translated into the CPUâ€™s native machine code on the fly. At the end, the outputs of the executed programs are consolidated into a 256-bit result, using a cryptographic hashing function (_Blake2b_).

In **Panthera**, the [Blake2b](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BLAKE_\(hash_function\)) hash is further hashed using Yescrypt-RH and KangarooTwelve, which makes it much more difficult for GPUs to attain an unfair advantage, and which also allows the algorithm to be resistant to ASICs/FPGAs and level 2 quantum computers.
